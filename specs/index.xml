      <description>Introduction This part of the specification introduces you to (cloak) &amp;ndash; what it was &amp;ndash; what it is &amp;ndash; what it should be. Cloak daemon schedules tasks for applications and scripts and communicates back if you want it to. The goal is to make creation of cron tasks easy and quick and accessible.
 Cloak was a personal project that I (author) used to use on my backend server to run some tasks which executed in an interval Now cloak is an API based task-runner runner which stores and runs task not only in a given interval but also at a specific date and time.</description>
