# ðŸ““ Getting Started

Before you can use Rubik you need to make sure that development environment is up-to-date and ensure that everything is
setup correctly. Let's go throught the requirements of Rubik first.

## Install Go

Rubik Framework is written using Go programming language but you'll need Go runtime to execute your Rubik server. The
[official Go installation](https://golang.org/doc/install) guide provides you with a step by step instruction to install `Go`.

Testing your Go installation:

```bash
# this command outputs the version of Go runtime that you have installed
go version
```
