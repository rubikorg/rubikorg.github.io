Rubik was created from the inspiration of many frameworks like Django, Loopback, Flask etc. The idea here is to quickly get started with building web client-server apps in Go and have fun while building it.

do not believe in who is experienced and/or beginner. Everyone can play a part in this project and make it a joy to use.
