### Introduction

This part of the specification introduces you to _(cloak)_ -- what it **was** -- what it **is** -- what it **should be**. Cloak daemon schedules tasks for applications and scripts and communicates back if you want it to. The goal is to make creation of cron tasks easy and quick and accessible.

- Cloak **was** a personal project that I _(author)_ used to use on my backend server to run some tasks which executed in an interval
- Now cloak **is** an API based task-runner runner which stores and runs task not only in a given interval but also at a specific date and time. Cloak-Time-Format _(CTF)_ is being introduced and v0.0.1 is in the works for general public.
- Cloak **should be** a stateful task-runner, meaning, that it should remember state and should be able to run task with context.

### Internal Working

#### Cloak Certificate

A cloak certificate will be saved at `~/.cloak/cloakcrt`  with alpha-numeric string generated using your machine-id, which ensures that only authorized tasks are scheduled from another host as well as this host.

#### Cloak Registration
Cloak can run tasks from different application and it is important to register an application for 2 main reasons:

* Applications with same name should not create new tasks /(eg: by workers)/
* Applications with same task name can be removed easily
* Maintians ownership _(is currently in a quasi phase)_ --- you wouldn't want one application stopping other's task and start a quarrel

#### Cloak Daemon
Although cloak runs as daemon service it receives new tasks from a HTTP endpoints. Defaulr server port is `:12133` and has only 4 endpoints:

> *Cloak certificate content* must be sent as `Authorization` header for each request as `Bearer` token.

* <span class="api-method-post">POST</span> **`/register`** - registers an application with cloak daemon to create entities
	* `app`: name of the app
* <span class="api-method-post">POST</span> **`/add`** - adds a task
	* `app`: name of the app
	* `name`: name of the task (why naming task is important ?)
	* `type`: `file` or `command`or`plain`
	* `target`: `path` to binary or `command` to run or simple `callback` to the topic
	
    >  events will be sent to `app:taskName` to avoid conflicts between apps
	
    * `ctf`: cloak time format string for scheduling 
* <span class="api-method-post">POST</span> **`/remove`** - removes a task
	* `app`: name of the app
	* `name`: task name to remove
* <span class="api-method-get">GET</span> **`/list`** - retrieve a list of tasks for a project
	* `app`: name of the app
	* `name`: task name to remove
    * `status`: filter using status


#### Cloak Database

Cloak uses BoltDB for saving and managing status of the tasks mostly because of its key value nature, and a single application can be viewed as a bucket in BoltDB.

#### Cloak Events
Cloak events are a way to notify the subscriber of any events that is happening on a `project` level.

#### Cloak Task Functions (CTF)
Cloak task functions makes it easy to define tasks whenever you want with simple function definitions. 

_**Note:** the '$' is just to specify that it is a value and should not be included while providing the value._

- `.date($value)` - this function provides the exact date at which this task should run. The format of date accepted by cloak is `YYYY-MM-DD`. It runs the task at **00:00** on the specified date.
- `.time($value)` - this function accepts a 24 hour time format _(HH:MM)_ that schedules your command to run on a specific time. 

> A combiation of _.date(), .time() & .repeat()_ is possible which will start from specified .date at the specefied .time and repeat with 'N' interval.

- `.repeat($value)` - this function lets you specify the repeat interval for a given task. Accepted suffixes:
    - **d**: day
    - **h**: hour
    - **m**: minute
    - **s**: second

> Why can't you have month or a year suffix which can be a lot of help? ----- May be "I don't know". It is kind of vague in terms of the usability of repeat after an interval of a month or a year, to not over-complicate the working and the boundaries of CTFs it is recommended to use .date()

- `.day($values)` - this function adds a filter to the above functions. Accepted values are `sun, mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat` and multiple filter can be provided as _**comma-separated**_ values.

#### Cloak Task and it's States

Cloak task can only be present in these 4 states:

1. `Completed`: A task was completed successfully with a 0 exit code _(A completed task is a one-shot task that ran succesfully in the past and not re-scheduled by the cloak scheduler)_
2. `Running`: A task is currently running
3. `Scheduled`: This task has been scheduled
4. `Errored`: A task has exited with non-zero exit code _(An errored task is never re-scheduled)_

##### Q&A: How to specify for a task to run every day when .day() only accepts the following values? Write all 7 days?
- `.repeat(1d)` should do the trick

#### Edge-cases: What happens if you don’t specify some modifiers ?

 * Even though the modifiers not specified, if cloak has enough information about the occurrence and the day/date, it’ll schedule for the current time
 * If `occurrence`is not specified, it’ll run the task at a specific `day/date` once.
 * If `occurrence` and `day/date` is not specified but the `time` is specified, and if time has not yet passed yet it’ll run once at the given `time`

#### Things that has not yet made the draft

- `cloak console` to get realtime view of tasks that are running and to stop or delete a task.
- `cloak rebuild` which can rebuild the same tasks and applications from one server inside another server
