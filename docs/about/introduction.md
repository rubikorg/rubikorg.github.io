## Prologue

Rubik aims to provide the tools and programmable APIs needed to quickly handle your server-side needs.

Rubik has a robust layer of Go's reflection supporting the whole framework and provide many simple
high-level APIs for handling complex tasks. The directory structure of Rubik is minimal but effective.

Among other things, Rubik will serve as a great replacement for your server-side needs and will in turn
provide many pluggable blocks.

### Goals

= Keep a small footprint, this is a micro-framework and will always be one.

= Provide Block _(extenstion)_ APIs that can basically support any integration

= Support this micro-framework with extensive tooling, which is to be focused always.
Writing APIs quickly is of utmost priority.

### Concerns

Apart from being [@my](https://twitter.com/ashish_shekar) largest project in terms of sheer code size I think it needs
to be trimmed down in the upcoming releases. In order to stay small it must let go of some features in any of the
following alpha releases.
